## Built With

This is a <a href="https://weather-dashboard-using-react-2025.vercel.app" target="_blank">Weather Dashboard App</a> build with react and vite.

This app will provide the weather information.
For getting the weather information, user should have allow the browser to get the location lattitude and longitude information. It should be done only first time visit. It is safe, I have used Javascript GEOLOCATION API to solve this task.

User can also find weather information from the search box.
User can also add any location to favourite list if he/she likes.
User can also find weather information from the favourite list later.
This favourite list will be saved by browser local storage. So the favourite list would not be deleted if user close the browser.

I have used a free weather API for practice purpose, so the information is relatively close but not 100% accurate like google.

- React.js
